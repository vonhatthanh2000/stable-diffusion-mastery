## How to Structure Prompts

**How to Build Prompts**

The length and details of the prompt can be simple. A single word is enough.

However, short prompts use the default style, giving creative freedom in the interpretation of unspecified details. Include all the elements that are important to you. Fewer details mean more variety, but less control.

Try to make clear which relationships or details are important to you. Consider the following:

- **Theme:** Person, animal, character, place, object
- **Medium:** Photo, painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle
- **Setting:** Indoors, outdoors, on the moon, underwater, in the city
- **Lighting:** Soft, ambient, cloudy, neon, studio lights
- **Color:** Vibrant, muted, bright, monochrome, colorful, black and white, pastel
- **Mood:** Thoughtful, calm, exuberant, energetic
- **Composition:** Portrait, headshot, close-up, bird’s-eye view
- **Aspect ratio:** 1:1, 16:9, etc.

**THE CLOSER A WORD IS TO THE FRONT, THE MORE EMPHASIS IT WILL HAVE!**

- Cat, angry = Cat gets more emphasis
- Angry cat = Angry gets more emphasis

**Example prompt:**

"An illustration of a cat, relaxed, in a city, in vibrant colors, full-body view, at golden hour, with a 16:9 aspect ratio."
